				<h3>RICK SANCHEZ</h3>
				<p>Rick Sanchez is a brilliant but deeply troubled scientist whose reckless and often morally ambiguous behavior stems from his nihilistic worldview. Sporting his signature lab coat and perpetually drooling mouth, Rick is a master of interdimensional travel, often creating bizarre gadgets and concocting elaborate schemes. His intelligence and resourcefulness are matched only by his self-destructive tendencies and disregard for social norms, making him a complex and unpredictable character. Despite his many flaws, Rick occasionally shows glimpses of genuine care for his family, particularly his grandson Morty, albeit in his own twisted way. 
				</p>
				<h3>MORTY SMITH</h3>
				<p>Morty Smith, on the other hand, is a kind-hearted and impressionable teenager who often finds himself reluctantly dragged into Rick's dangerous and surreal escapades. Balancing the challenges of high school with the unpredictable chaos of his grandfather's adventures, Morty serves as a moral compass and a grounding force for Rick. Throughout their interdimensional travels, Morty faces numerous bizarre and often life-threatening situations, which force him to grow and develop resilience. Despite the constant danger and ethical dilemmas, Morty's loyalty to his family, especially his complicated bond with Rick, remains a central theme of the show.
